## 🌟 Key Features

*   **🧣 Wearable Comfort:** Lightweight and ergonomic design suitable for pets of all sizes.
*   **📡 Non-Invasive Scanning:** Proprietary low-power light scanning technology assesses ocular parameters without contact.
*   **📱 Real-Time Data:** Continuous monitoring transmits data to a user-friendly mobile app.
*   **🚨 Early Alert System:** Instant notifications for owners and vets about potential issues.

## 🛠️ Technology

Our core innovation relies on advanced biometric sensing:

*   **💡 Advanced Light Spectrum Analysis:** Penetrates ocular tissues to detect subtle changes.
*   **🩸 Micro-Vascular Flow Detection:** Monitors blood flow in retinal/corneal micro-vasculature.
*   **📉 Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Estimation:** Non-invasive AI-driven IOP estimation for glaucoma detection.
*   **🧠 Neural Network Processing:** On-device AI interprets data and filters false positives.

## 🏥 The Problem It Solves

Many ocular conditions (glaucoma, cataracts) go undetected until it's too late. 😢
*   **Subtle Symptoms:** Hard for owners to notice.
*   **Infrequent Check-ups:** Vets can't monitor 24/7.
*   **Invasive Diagnostics:** Traditional methods can be stressful.

**SANS Collar** bridges this gap! 🌉
